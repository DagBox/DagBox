         * worker should be considered dead if it hasn't communicated
         * with the broker. This value should be larger than the time
         * an average request would take.
         *
         * \param transport_delay The amount of time a message
         * generally takes to be transported through the chosen
         * transport. This value is used by the broker to give more
         * time to workers for their responses to reach before marking
         * them as dead.
